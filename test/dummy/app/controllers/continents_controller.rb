# this Controller shows a set of all possible and useful resource (CRUD) methods
# note that all methods are used as the bang-version, since the goal is to achieve an api for a clientside-framework
# see http://stackoverflow.com/a/1761180 for infos about Active Record's bang-methods
#
# you're free to use the none-bang versions, which return false instead of an exception if an error occurs
# the bang-free versions are tested in the model tests
